# How to preserve the screen recording
#preparation before recording
1. download and install obs studio
2. open obs studio and set the needed parameters
   2-1. profile
	  >> new
	    >> "-name your profile-" ("PowerShellScreenRecording")

   2-2. Scene collection
	  >> new
	    >>  "-name your scene-" ("test")

   2-3.	add the sources you want in your scene 
	(here I only use 2 sources: "Display Capture" and "Audio Output Capture",
	 and name them literally)

# ensure that contents of parameters in ps1 script is the same as the names you just set in previous steps.

# change Execution Policy (safety status) to run a script
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
 	# restore the policy: Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy restricted

# run the script
powershell.exe -File "C:\Users\s9402\OneDrive\桌面\Screen Recording.ps1"
  # or execute in background process
     Start-Job -FilePath "C:\Users\s9402\OneDrive\桌面\Screen Recording.ps1"
